# Introduction

Active learning using random sampling, entropy uncertainty, vote entropy, and dropout uncertainty. The model used is [Kim's CNN for Sentence Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) in Pytorch lent from [this repository](https://github.com/Shawn1993/cnn-text-classification-pytorch), which is extended with active learning.
